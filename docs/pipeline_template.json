  # 7 noises in total[wm, csf, gs, motion, acompcor, aroma, spikes]
  # for [acompcor, aroma] assign True if you want to add it for denoise and False if not.
  # for [wm, csf, gs, motion] assign False if not to include, and if wanted, add two sub-level keys for 'temp_deriv' and 'quad_terms' and assign True or False to them.
  # for [spikes] assign False if no spike is wanted, and if wanted two sub-key 'fd_th' and 'dvars_th' need to be added:
  ## fd_th: framewise_displacement threshold, numeric which scans have fd greater thant it will be identified as outliers. 
  ## dvars_th: std_dvars threshold, numeric which scans have std_dvars greater thant it will be identified as outliers.
